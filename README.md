# JOS_sample
Sample of work from my Operating Systems course

- Built a JOS in a Unix environment. Used QEMU to emulate the operating sytem. GNUmakefile should have appropriate instructions for building.
- Tried to retrieve from private repository from class but doesn't seem to be completely up-to-date. Will work on this when I can.
